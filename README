log file format:
token_len (int)
token (str)
entry_len1 (int)
ts (int)
name (str)
E/G (char)
A/L (char)
roomID (int, -1 for gallery and >=0 for rooms)
entry_len2 (int)
ts (int)
name (str)
E/G (char)
A/L (char)
roomID (int, -1 for gallery and >=0 for rooms)



Issues To Fix:
    logread.c:
        Avoid using fixed sized arrays and MAX_NAME_LEN, because input names and number of rooms can be arbitrarily long.
        Haven't consider the -2 room situation.
    logappend.c:
        Implement batching.
        Try to read a whole file into a buf once rather than read it multiple times. In this way it is a lot more easier for decrypt.
