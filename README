log file format:
token_len (int)
token (str)
entry_len1 (int)
ts (int)
name (str)
E/G (char)
A/L (char)
roomID (int, -1 for gallery and >=0 for rooms)
entry_len2 (int)
ts (int)
name (str)
E/G (char)
A/L (char)
roomID (int, -1 for gallery and >=0 for rooms)



Issues To Fix:
    logread.c:
        Verify input log file exists. Currently if log file doesn't exist, program crashes.
        Get rid of debugging printf statements since autolab likely requires identical stdout as expected.
        Differentiate between employee and guest. Currently both -S and -R ignores whether given input is an employee or an guest.
        Avoid using fixed sized arrays and MAX_NAME_LEN, because input names and number of rooms can be arbitrarily long.
    logappend.c:
        Implement batching.
