log file format:
(file header)
    token_len (int)
    token (str)
(repeating fields for entries)
    entry_len (int)
    ts (int)
    name (str)
    E/G (char)
    A/L (char)

Issues To Fix:
    general:
        Fix Test 5 and 6 (basic-flag-checking).
        Implement optional feature to pass 3 optional tests.
        Free memory after heap usage.
    logread.c:
        Avoid using fixed sized arrays and MAX_NAME_LEN, because input names and number of rooms can be arbitrarily long.
    logappend.c:
        Implement batching.
        Try to read a whole file into a buf once rather than read it multiple times. In this way it is a lot more easier for decrypt.
